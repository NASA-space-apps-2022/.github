### ABOUT WISSE:
Ever feel like everyone is talking about climate change... but it doesn't affect you at all? Did you know that more than 7 out of 10 coastal floods are caused by human action? All this information exists and is available, but very few are aware of it. Realizing this problem, we decided to create WISSE, an easy-to-use learning platform with interactive games and activities for people to learn, raise awareness about climate change and its effects, and be part of the solution. For this purpose, we applied data analysis to NASA OLYMPEX mission data and other sources to determine the climatological phenomena affecting Washingtonâ€™s community. We believe everyone can be WISSE, let's take action.
